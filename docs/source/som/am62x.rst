********************
General Information
********************

   **The byteENGINE AM62xx** is a high performance industrial oriented computing module. It allows a short time-to-market, while reducing development costs and substantial design risks.

   **The system on module (SOM)** uses the Texas Instruments AM62xx industrial applications processor family. The new, highly integrated Sitara AM62xx processor provides industrial-grade reliability, with dual and quad Arm Cortex-A53 core variants. AM62xx is built for a broad set of Industrial and Automotive applications. The inclusion of an on-chip isolated dual-core microcontroller (MCU) subsystem enables designers to use the AM62xx to create more dependable and functional safety-certifiable products while reducing overall system-level complexity.

   The **AM62xx** contains up to four Arm® Cortex®-A53 cores with 64-bit, Single-core Arm® Cortex®-R5F Device Manager subsystem, IMG AXE1-16 3D graphics module, dual-core PRU module and a Cortex®-M4F MCU module. The Cortex-A53 provides powerful computing elements for Linux applications. AM62xx has a powerful IMG AXE1-16 3D Graphics core for HMI applications and QT acceleration with dual display output options at resolutions up to 2K @60 fps. The 2-port Gigabit Ethernet switch has one internal port and two external ports with TSN support. An additional PRU module enables real-time I/O capability. In addition, an extensive peripherals set is included in AM62xx to enable system level connectivity such as USB, MMC/ SD, Camera interface, OSPI, CAN-FD and GPMC for parallel host interface to an external ASIC/FPGA. AM62xx also supports secure boot for IP protection with the built-in HSM (Hardware Security Module) and also employs advanced power management support for portable and power-sensitive applications
